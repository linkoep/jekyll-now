## Welcome to my Blog!
My name is Linus Koepfer, and I'm a Computer Science/Computer Systems
Engineering major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). This
blog/website/whatever it becomes is intended to be a place for me to showcase
my projects, write about my experiences, and possibly as a source of
information for anyone trying similar things.
