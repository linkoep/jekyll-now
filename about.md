#### Basics
My name is Linus, and I'm a current junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
I'm pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Computer Systems
Engineering, with a minor in Economics, and will be graduating in May 2020. I
love to tinker and build new things, and I try to always be learning something
new. In my free time, I like to make music, play frisbee, and watch cooking videos.

#### Interests
When it comes to programming and engineering, I have a wide variety of interests. The following is a mix of technologies I've worked with and those that I want to learn more about.
- Full Stack Web Development
	- Backend: Java, Python, Node.js
	- Frontend: Angular, Vue, React
- DevOps
	- Serverless (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, AWS SAM)
	- CI/CD (Git, Jenkins, Travis CI)
- IoT and Smart Devices
- Machine Learning, Neural Networks, NLP

#### Hobbies
I love to make music. I play piano and saxophone, and dabble in drums, ukulele,
and whatever else I can find. I currently play in the Afro-Cuban Jazz
Orchestra at RPI, and join the RPI Pep Band when I have the time.

I also discovered the wonderful sport of Ultimate Frisbee when I came to RPI,
and now spend most of my nights at practice and my weekends at tournaments.
I'm B-Team captain of [RPI Trudge](http://frisbee.union.rpi.edu/).
