Hi there, and thanks for checking out my site! [I'm Linus]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}), and I
plan on using this site as a sort of portfolio/blog for my various software and
hardware projects. Some context: It's the end of freshman year, I have finals
coming up in a few weeks, and then a summer internship at 3M. Luckily, I've
managed to find some free time to get this blog set up, and I have a big trello
board of projects just waiting to go. More to come!
