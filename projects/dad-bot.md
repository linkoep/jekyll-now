title: '"DadBot" Twitter Bot'
---
I've prototyped a simple twitter bot that uses the twitter API to reply to
tweets containing the phrase "I'm {something}" with "Hi {something}! I'm Dad".
Twitter doesn't like automated replies to random users, so I'm in the process
of adding some filters and configuration to comply with their regulations
before I can run the bot full time. Check out the code
[here](https://github.com/linkoep/DadBot), or find it on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/Hi_Im_Dad_/with_replies).
