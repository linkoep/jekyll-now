Hi there! 
Thanks for checking out my website! 

My name is Linus Koepfer, and I'm
a junior Computer Science/Computer Systems Engineering dual major at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute. I love all sorts of engineering and programming, from
IoT projects and microcontrollers to full stack web development and DevOps.

Feel free to check out some of my [personal projects](/projects), or read about
what I've been up to on my (infrequently updated) [blog](/blog). You can also
find me on various platforms via the links in the footer, and if you're an
employer, my [resume](/resume/Linus_Koepfer_Resume.pdf) is available as well.
