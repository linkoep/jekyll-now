## Welcome to my Blog!
My name is Linus Koepfer, and I'm a freshman[^1] at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
(RPI). This blog/website/whatever it becomes is intended to be a place for me
to showcase my projects, write about my experiences, and possibly as a source
of information for anyone trying similar things.

[^1]: Sophomore by graduation date[^2]
