title: Frequency Detection
---
As part of the Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS), I am working with a
team of RPI students on a hardware device that can be used to detect cell phone
usage in the classroom. We are currently in the early planning stages of the
project, but ultimately plan to design and print a custom PCB for the purpose. 
More information can be found at the [project repo](https://github.com/allcog/cell_phone_detection)
